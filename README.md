**Test Guru First**

**Hi 👋**

Part 1 (Do not forget see second part https://github.com/dastanabeuov/TestSecond)

This web application for quizzes and tests.
Online testing.
User with rights (user && admin).
Base of tests with questions. The user answers questions by choosing an answer option (correct answers to questions and other answers).
After the test is completed, the program displays the result and issues a certificate.

Of course, not all points are covered here. I will only be glad if you have a desire to discuss points 🙌


System requirements:
ruby-2.5.1
rails-5.2.1

🥷If you have questions that you would like to discuss, I'm ready to listen.
